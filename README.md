This project is in a super-early stage. Currently I'm testing that models work.

Requires a recent GZDoom devbuild, as this mod will eventually target GZDoom 4.10 (or 5.0, whichever comes first).

### The Plans

 - Unlike the first Doom Tournament, this one won't be a 1:1 replication, it is technically impossible.
 - I will re-use as much code from Demolitionist as possible to make things easier.
 - The mod will feature all weapons and items related to Deathmatch. This excludes the AVRiL, Ion/Target Painter, Grenade Launcher, Mine Layer and Ball Launcher (obviously).
 - Options to have UT2003 versions of the weapons as reskins will be available (behavior won't change, however).
 - Option to bring back a dummied out Impact Hammer (the model was ripped haphazardly and needs to be rigged and animated from scratch).
 - There will be an option for alternating between spawning the Lightning Gun (which I think sucks) and the classic Sniper Rifle.
 - There will be no vehicles, for very reasonable reasons.
 - All-original replacements for some items will be needed, like in Doom Tournament (Invulnerability, Lite-Amp, Computer Map, Backpack, Blursphere, Radsuit, Keys).
 - All characters will be included, but they won't have team color skins, to save space.
 - Bone manipulation is essential for this project, so development won't start until after that's implemented into GZDoom.
